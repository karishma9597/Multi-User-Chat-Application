This project is a real-time, multi-user chat application developed using Python's low-level network programming capabilities (sockets) and concurrency management (threading). It consists of a central server and multiple client applications, enabling users to communicate instantaneously in a shared chat room. This project effectively demonstrates fundamental concepts of network communication, concurrent programming, and basic application-level protocols.
